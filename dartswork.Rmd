## Introduction

The 2013 semi-final Grand Slam of Darts match between Phil Taylor and
Adrian Lewis is often described as the greatest ever played.  Here I
analyse the players' performance.


```{r}
library("magrittr")
source("usefulfuncs.R")
a <- read.table("taylor_lewis.txt",skip=1,header=TRUE)
for(i in 1:25){is_ok_leg(leg(a,i))}
head(a)
```

and have some fun

```{r}
M <- matrix(0,2,2)
dimnames(M) <- list(starter=c("lewis","taylor"),winner=c("lewis","taylor"))
for(i in 1:25){
  M[starter(leg(a,i)),winner(leg(a,i))] %<>% `+`(1)
}
```
